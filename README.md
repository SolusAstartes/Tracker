Tracker (Solution Code)
========================
Written for NDTS(Natural Disaster Tracking System) project at my internship in Havelsan.

The tracker demonstrates the use of the accelerometer and geomagnetic field
sensors to determine the device's orientation. Using an accelerometer and gyroscope, the tracker checks whether the building is collapsed or shaking.
Sends sensor data via HTTP to Ubidots. Data is visualized in the dashboard.
Sends and receives data from operator device via Wi-fi direct.
Could potentially work with smartwatches to send heartbeat data to Incident Response Center so in the event of a collapse they can quickly get information about the rescue operator's health.
